I just made this with some mashed potatoes.

## What you need
* A thicc round steak. I used top sirloin medallions.
* Bacon
* Butter, salt, and pepper
* Oil. Fancy folks use olive oil, but I use peanut because I don’t like hitting my fire alarm with a broom.
* Aluminum foil
* Toothpicks
* Pans and stuff

## Do this
* Preheat your oven to 450°F or 232°C
* Put some oil and butter in a pan and heat on medium-high
* While that is heating:
	* Season your steak with salt and pepper
	* Wrap a slide of bacon around the perimeter of the steak
	* Secure bacon with toothpicks
* Pop that bad boy onto the pan and sear quickly on both sides
* Plop your meat onto a bit of foil, put on a baking tray, and pop it into the oven for about 7 minutes. Use a meat thermometer if you’re picky about the wellness of your beef.
* Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes
* Remove toothpicks and eat. Or don’t remove them, I don’t judge your lifestyle.
