You’ll want to dig up some of your backyard stash for this.<br/>

## What you need
* A can of black beans
* Mango
* Cilantro
* Red onion
* Bell pepper
* Lime juice
* Vinegar (I used apple cider because that’s what I had)
* Red pepper flakes
* (optional) Other stuff, e.g. halved cherry tomatoes, corn

## Do this
* Drain and rinse the black beans. I heard you can save the bean juice for something
* Finely chop the onion, cilantro, and pepper
* Cut the mango into small cubes
* Mix everything in a plastic tub in whatever desired proportions you enjoy
* Add lime juice, vinegar, and red pepper to taste<br/>
<br/>
Pop that tub of beans in the fridge and protect at all costs.
