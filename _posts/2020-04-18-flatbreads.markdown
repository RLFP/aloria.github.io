They’re bread and they’re flat.<br/>

## What you need
* 1.5 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 0.5 teaspoons salt
* Vegetable oil (1.5 tablespoons for the dough, more for frying)
* ~1.5 tablespoons Italian seasoning (or whatever herbs catch your fancy)
* ~1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
* ~0.5 cup cold water
* Stuff to put on your flatbread. I chose halved cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and roasted red peppers.
* Cling wrap
* A skillet
* A bowl

## Do this
* Mix dry ingredients in a bowl
Add the oil and water and mix until it starts to look like dough. Add more water (or milk if you want a puffier flatbread) and flour until the dough is pliable but not sticky
* Wrap your dough in the cling wrap and let rest for at least 10 minutes
* On high heat, add enough oil to cover the bottom of the skillet
Divide dough into ~4 sections. Squish dough into a ball and then squash flat. You can also use a rolling pin for thinner bread.
* Dust both sides of breads with flour
* Fry your little dough babies for about 2 minutes on each side, more or less depending on how thicc they are
* Remove from oil. Top with whatever. What I did:
Top flatbreads with alternating slices of mozarella and roasted peppers. Add halved cherry tomatoes to the finalcheese layer. I would have also used fresh basil if I had any.
* Broil flatbreads until cheese has melted and the tomatoes start to wrinkle.
