But just buy it from the store, seriously.<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* 3 or 4 large eggs
* 10 oz all-purpose flour

## Do this
* Make a mound of the flour, creating a well in the middle
* Yes, just like your baking soda volcano "science experiment" in elementary
* Crack three of the eggs into the well
* Slowly mix with a fork, to make a dough ball
* If it's dry, add the yolk from the fourth egg
* If it's still too dry, add the white
* I guess keep going with more eggs if it's still too dry (how much flour did you use???)
* You could also do all of this in a mixer
* Once it forms a ball, knead for 15 to 20 minutes (yeah, definitely use a mixer)
* Wrap it in plastic, let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes
<br/>
* Cut about a fourth of the ball off
* Roll it out with a pasta machine! Done!
* You don't have a pasta machine because you're a normal human being?
* Roll it out on a floured surface, like a large cutting board
* Roll dough out in one direction
* Flip it over and roll it out in the other
* Flip it again, turn it 90 degrees, and so on
* You're stretching the dough until it is very thin
* Like, thin enough to see the grains of the cutting board through it
* That's thin!
* Slice into strips with a very sharp knife
* Repeat three more times with the rest of the dough
* Use in any recipe that asks for fresh pasta
* Realize you really, really should have just bought it at the store
