YOU’LL GO APE FOR THIS BANANA BREAD AHAHAHAHAHA<br/>
<br/>
AHAHAHAHAHAH<br/>
<br/>
AHAHAHAHAA oh god I haven’t left the house in 3 months<br/>

## What you need
* Parchment paper
* 2 cups flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* .25 tsp salt
* .5 tsp ground cinnamon
* .25 tsp ground clove
* .75 cups brown sugar
* .5 cups of softened butter
* 2 eggs
* .25 cup of sour cream or yogurt (IDK why)
* 4 overripe bananas
* 2 shots of dark rum (I used Kracken)

## Do this
* Preheat oven to 350°F
* Line a 9×5 inch pan with parchment paper
* Mix dry ingredients in a bowl until well combined
* In another bowl, smash the heck out of the bananas. You’re gonna want to take the peels off first.
* Mix the wet ingredients in with the bananas, except only add one shot of rum
* Gradually combine the wet and dry ingredients together and mix well
* Pour that stuff into your pan and cram it in the oven
* Bake for about 60 minutes, until a toothpick in the center comes out clean
* Let bread cool for about 10 minutes in the pan. Do the other shot of rum while you’re waiting.
* You can substitute maple syrup for the rum, but I wouldn’t recommend doing shots of it.<br/>
<br/>
I also made honey butter as a spread. Just mix equal amounts of honey and softened butter together.<br/>
