[HOW MANY SHRIMP DO YOU HAVE TO EAT<br/>BEFORE IT MAKES YOUR SKIN TURN PINK<br/>EAT TOO MUCH AND YOU’LL GET SICK<br/>SHRIMPS ARE PRETTY RICH](https://youtu.be/oQY_xAmywxk)<br/>

## What You Need
* 1 pound of shrimps
* A lemon
* Fresh parsley
* Chili flakes
* 2 shallots
* 3 or more cloves of garlic
* 0.5 cup of dry white wine
* Salt and pepper
* ~8 oz of some sort of pasta, like linguine. I used regular spaghetti because that’s what we had.
* Butter
Olive oil

## Do This
* Get a big-ass pot of water and get it boiling, then cook your pasta to just under al-dente. Drain and set aside if it finishes cooking before you complete the rest of the steps.
* Crush or finely mince the garlic
* Chop up enough parsley so you have about 2 tablespoons worth
* Zest the lemon
* Finely chop the shallots. They know what they did.
* Melt about 2 tablespoons of butter and a bit of olive oil on medium high heat
* Add the shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes and cook until the shallots become translucent
* Season the shrimp liberally with salt and pepper and add to the pan. Cook until pink, then remove the shrimp.
* Note1: you can use precooked shrimp for this, just thaw it first and add it at the next step instead
* Note2: this would be an opportune time to remove the tails from your shrimp if you want. Personally, I think people who eat the tails of shrimp are just as weird as people who eat the skin on kiwi fruit.
* Add the wine, lemon zest, and squeeze the juice of the lemon into the pan. Bring to a boil.
* Add another 2 tablespoons of butter and olive oil and re-introduce the shrimp
* Add the parsley and pasta
* Season with more salt and pepper if desired<br/>
