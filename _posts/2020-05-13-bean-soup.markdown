Chard \>\>\> kale. Fight me.<br>

## What You Need
* 1 small- medium white or yellow onion
* A bunch of garlic. I used ~5 cloves.
* 1 tsp paprika (I used hot Hungarian paprika)
* (optional) red pepper flakes or chili powder
* 1 can of white beans
* 2-3 cups chicken broth
* Lemon juice
* 2 sausages. I used some weird citrus chicken sausage.
* 2-3 big-ass chard leaves
* Olive oil

## Do This
* Finely dice your onion and garlic
* Cut sausages lengthwise and then cut into chunks
* In some sort of pot (I used my instant pot on saute mode,) heat up enough oil to cover the bottom. Cook onions until translucent.
* Add sausage, garlic, paprika, and any other desired spices and saute for about 3 minutes
* Add beans (donâ€™t drain them, you want that sweet-ass aquafaba to thicken the soup) and broth
* Put a lid on the pot and simmer for 30 minutes (or put your instant pot into soup mode)
* Cut the stems off the chard leaves. Rip up the leaves into small pieces and toss them into the soup with the lemon juice
* Cook for ~10 minutes until chard is wilted. Add salt and pepper to taste.
* EAT THE SOUP
