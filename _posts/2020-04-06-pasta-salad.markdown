\*slaps tupperware container\* This bad boy can fit so many ingredients in it.<br/>

## What you need
* A pot for boiling pasta
* Some sort of container for your food to reside in
* 1 package tri-color rotini
* ~2 cups of some sort of dressing. I use a bottle of low-fat Italian dressing, but you do you.
* Red onion
* Bell pepper
* Parsley
* (optional) Other accouterments, such as cheese, cherry tomatoes, salami.

##  Do this
* Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil
* While the water is boiling, chop your vegetables and herbs and meats and whatever else you’re putting in this jawn
* Cook pasta according to the box until al-dente, or just under. Your pasta is going to soak up the dressing and flavors from the rest of the ingredients, so don’t over cook it.
* Drain the pasta and rinse with cold water
* Stir in the dressing and whatever you just chopped up
* Plop that stuff in some sort of storage container and stuff it in the fridge. Give it a good stir or shake every once in a while until the pasta has absorbed the dressing.<br/>

If you used salami and have a cat, you must give it a little salami. I don’t make the rules.
