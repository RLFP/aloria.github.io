This is also sometimes known as cream cheese pie. <br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* 8 oz package of cream cheese, room temp
* 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk
* 1/3 cup lemon juice
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 9" pre-made Graham cracker crust
* Any fruit pie filling (cherry goes very well with this)

## Do this
* Mix cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk, lemon juice, and vanilla until smooth
* Pour into pie tin
* Chill for several hours
* Slice and top with fruit pie filling<br/>
<br/>
This does not set as "hard" as real cheesecake. It should be soft, but not runny.
