Yes, this is the post I am starting my blog with. We all need an egg in these trying times.

## What you need
* An Instant Pot
* That steamer rack/ basket thing that comes with the Instant Pot
* Eggs. Obviously.
* A cup of water
* A bowl of ice water

## Do this
1. Put the cup of water in the Instant Pot.
2. Put the steamer thing in.
3. Put the eggs on the steamer thing. Don’t put too many eggs in and overcrowd it.
4. Put the lid on and seal the Instant Pot. Hit that manual setting button and select high pressure. Set time 6-7 minutes depending on how swole your eggs are. Quick release pressure after time is up.
5. Plop those eggs in the ice water and let them chill out (heheh) for a couple minutes. Peel them or stick them in the fridge. IDK, it’s your life.
