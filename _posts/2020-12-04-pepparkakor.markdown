It's Swedish for "pepper cookie" but it's basically a gingersnap<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* 3/4 cups flour
* 1/8 tsp baking soda
* 4 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
* 3 tbsp white sugar
* 1/8 cup molasses
* 1 tbsp ground ginger
* 1/8  tsp orange extract
* a pinch of kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves
* 1/8 tsp black pepper
* 1 egg



## Do this
* Mix flour and baking soda in a bowl large enough for your purposes
* Put butter, sugar, molasses, ginger, cinnamon, orange extract, salt, cloves, and pepper in a saucepan over medium heat
* Whisk until sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer. Remove from heat and cool until it's not hot enough to melt your flesh off (~30 mins)
* Whisk egg into the cooled mixture until smooth
* Pour over the dry ingredients and fold with spatula until no dry flour remains
* Refrigerate at least 2 hours
* Heat the oven to 350 F
* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper
* Working with a tablespoonful of dough at a time, use dampened hands to roll into balls. Arrange 12 dough balls on each baking sheet, spacing evenly.
* Lay a sheet of plastic wrap over your balls on each sheet and squash them to 1/4 inch thick
* Remove the plastic and bake ~15 mins. They should be a deep brown color.
* Remove from the oven and let cool<br/>
