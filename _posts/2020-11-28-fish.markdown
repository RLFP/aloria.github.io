I usually use tilapia for this. I'm sure you can use cod or mahi mahi or something that will have people judge you less than using tilapia. <br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* Fish filets (I usually make around 4)
* 1 large red onion, sliced
* 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
* 1 lemon, sliced
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 5 tbsp melted butter
* 1 tbsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp chili flakes
* More spices: I use a blend of rosemary, black pepper, ground mustard seed, dried parsley, and oregano.
* Baking dish
* Aluminum foil

## Do this
* Preheat oven to 400Â°F
* Mix melted butter, lemon juice, garlic powder, and chili flakes together
* Line pan with foil 
* Spread a layer of sliced onions in the pan
* Season both sides of filets with the spice blend and add to pan
* Place sliced lemons on fish
* Add tomatoes evenly across pan
* Pour butter mixture over everything 
* Cover pan with foil
* Cook for approx. 10-15 minutes, until fish flakes when you cut it with a fork<br/>

I usually serve this over rice. You can learn how to make rice in an instant pot [here](/2020/11/06/grains).
