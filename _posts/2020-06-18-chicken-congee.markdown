By choosing this recipe, you’ve made the rice move\*<br/>
<br/>
\*this is not a cry for help<br/>

## What you need
* A bunch of chicken. I like to get a roast chicken and use the leftovers the day after because then I get to rip a carcass apart with my bare hands
* 2 cups of rice
* 8 cups of water
* To taste:
* Finely chopped ginger root
* Salt
* Pepper
* THE FLAVA ENHANCA (monosodium gultamate)
* Chili powder
* Chopped scallions

## Do this
(This are how I prep my chicken. You do you.)

* Place chicken carcass and ginger in a pot with enough water to cover. Yes, you want all the skin, fat, and bones in there.
* Bring to boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for about an hour
* Remove chicken, reserving liquid in the pot
* Once chicken is cool enough, pull the meat off the chicken bones and place back in the pot
* Some folks like to skim the fat off the water. I did not do this.
* Add the rest of the water, the rice, and your preferred seasonings
* Bring back to a boil, then simmer for about two hours depending on the type of rice you’re using (brown will take longer) until the congee reaches a porridge-like consistency. You may want to add more rice or water to achieve your desired thickness.
* Top with chopped scallions and consume<br/>
