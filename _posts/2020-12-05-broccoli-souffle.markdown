This is a retro recipe, that we always make around the holidays for parties - Tasty stuff!<br/>
<br/>

## What you need

* 2 Frozen packages (10 ounce) broccoli or equivalent fresh broccoli
* 1/2 Cup of chopped onion
* 4 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp flour
* 1/2 cup of water
* 1.5 cups of cubed Velveeta (You could use real cheese too, will just want something that melts well)
* 3 eggs, well beaten
* Optional - Bread crumbs

<br/>
For a bigger batch, just double the ingrediants<br/>

## Do this

* Thaw and drain broccoli, or chop up your fresh broccoli
* Pre-heat oven
  * 300°f if using a glass dish
  * 325°f if using a metal dish or pan
* Sauté the onion using the butter
* Add flour and water, stir well
* Add in the Velveeta, continue stirring until smooth and creamy
* Stir in the broccoli
* Gently stir in eggs
* Transfer this mixture to your baking dish/pan (I like disposable aluminum pans for this). Top with bread crumbs if desired _or_ cheese
* Bake for 45 minutes, you'll know it's done when it starts to firm up (Shake the pan to check).
  * **Note:** I've cooked this at sea-level and at an elevation of 5,280 feet, with the same results. Any higher than a mile high elevation and you may have to adjust cooking time/temps.
* Remove from the oven and enjoy! Cover with foil and bring to a friend's place, just pop in the oven to warm up<br/>
