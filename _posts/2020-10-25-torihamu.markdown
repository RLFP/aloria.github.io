It's chicken that sort of tastes like ham. You'll practically be a wizard if you make this.<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* Boneless chicken breasts
* Ziplock bags (1 for each breast)
* Plastic wrap
* Kitchen twine
* For each chicken breast:
  * 1 tbsp molasses
  * 1 tbsp brown sugar
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * 1 tsp black pepper
  * Thyme

## Do this
* Trim fat from chicken
* Squish chicken flat (cling wrap and a rolling pin works well for this)
* Stab each piece of chicken violently several times with a fork
* Mix sweeteners and black pepper in a bowl (skip the thyme for now)
* Divide each chicken breast and ~3 tbsp of sweetener mix into ziplock bags
* Squish the crap out of each bag so the chicken is well coated and somewhat demoralized 
* Seal bags and refrigerate for ~48 hours
* Rinse chicken off in cold water
* Roll each chicken breast tightly into a, well, roll
* Wrap each piece tightly in plastic 
* Bring a pot of water to a boil and add add chicken. Let boil for 5 minutes
* Turn heat off pot. Put a lit on the pot and let chicken sit for 1 hour
* Upwrap chicken and sprinke with thyme
* Marvel upon your creation and consider eating it<br/>
