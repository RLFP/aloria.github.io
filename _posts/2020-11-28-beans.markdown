I can't believe I had to scroll through a metric ass-ton of screens just to get instructions on how to cook beans. We live in dark times. <br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* Some kind of dried bean:
  * Kidney
  * Canelli
  * Black
  * Pinto
* (Optional) bay leaves, garlic, and/ or onion
## Do this
* Rinse your beans and make sure there are no rocks in there
* Add beans to Instant Pot
* Add water: for a pound (~2 cups) of beans, you need 8 cups of water
* Add bay leaves/ garlic/ onion if you're using them
* Set Instant Pot to high pressure for the following times:
  * Kidney: 30 minutes 
  * Canelli: 35 minutes
  * Black: 25 minutes
  * Pinto: 30 minutes
 * After time is up, you can quick release the pressure if you're impatient for beans<br/>
<br/> 
There. Beans. That was hard.
