This recipe was not an excuse for me to type the word “balls” repeatedly. I promise.

## What you need
* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 0.5 tsp black pepper
* 0.5 tsp chili powder
* 0.25 cups seasoned breadcrumbs
* As much crushed garlic as your little heart desires
* 1 tsbp Worcestershire sauce
* 0.5 tsp salt
* 0.5 tsp FLAVA ENHANCA aka MSG
* ~3 big-ass yellow or white onions
* Bacon
* A bottle of BBQ sauce. I use Sweet Baby Rays.
* 1 egg
* Toothpicks
* Parchment paper
* A baking pan

## Do this
* Preheat the oven to 450°F or 232°C
* Dice half of one of the onions
Mix the diced onions, beef, egg other seasonings in a bowl. Cram that bowl into your fridge while you complete the rest of your tasks
* Peel the other onions and cut them down the center from root to stem. Separate the outer layers.
* Line your baking pan with parchment paper
* Grab your bowl of meat and form them into your desired ball size. Remember that the onion layers are going to form a shell around your balls, so size accordingly.
* Use two of the halved onion layers to make a shell around the balls
* Wrap strips of bacon around the onion-ball things and secure with toothpicks
* Brush balls with BBQ sauce
* Bake for 45 minutes. Soak those balls in more BBQ sauce around halfway through cooking. You will need to cook less or more depending on the size of your balls.<br/>
