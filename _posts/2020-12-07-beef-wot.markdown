This is based on a recipe for the Ethiopian dish Key Wat, but since I didn't have the exact ingredients, I winged it and got this.<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* Instant Pot
* 0.5 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 0.25 tbsp ginger powder
* 1.5 tbsp curry powder
* 1 tbsp chinese five spice
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 cup water
* 1 large onion, diced
* 1.5 lbs beef, cubed or cut into strips


## Do this
* Put Instant Pot into saut√© mode and add butter
* Once butter is melted, add onion, ginger powder, and garlic powder. Cook until onion is caramelized (~1 min)
* Add tomato paste, water, and rest of spices. Cook for one minute
* Add beef. Seal lid and put Instant Pot into Meat/Stew mode and set for 30 minutes<br/>
<br/>
I serve this with rice but if you can get some of that awesome Ethiopian flatbread (injera,) you should use that<br/>
