Except better.<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
Cookies
* 1 Package Devil's Food Cake mix
* 2 eggs
* 3/4 cup shortening

Filling
* 8 oz package of cream cheese, room temp
* 1/4 cup butter
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 2 to 4 cups powdered sugar (to taste)

## Do this
* Mix cake mix, eggs, and shortening together.
* Roll into small balls of equal size (like a ping-pong ball)
* Place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper
* Bake at 350℉/175℃
* Wait for the cookies to cool!
* Combine filling ingredients together and mix throughly
* Start with two cups of powdered sugar and add more until it's sweet enough for you
* Spread filling, make two cookies into a sandwich
* Keep in refrigerator until serving
<br/>
The only downside to these is they don't really dip well in milk.
