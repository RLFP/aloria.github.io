My boyfriend’s mom made this for Christmas. She is a nice lady.<br/>

## What you need
* Lump crab meat (~8 oz)
* Seasoned breadcrumbs (~1 cup)
* 2 eggs
* Onion
* Bell pepper
* Garlic (she used one clove but go nuts)
* More spices (to taste):
* Crushed red pepper
* Salt
* Pepper
* Parsley
* Paprika
* Garlic powder
* Butter
* White wine
* Fish (she used ~4-5 flounder filets)
* A bowl
* A baking pan
* Toothpicks

## Do this
* Preheat oven to 350°F or 176°C
* Finely chop your bell pepper and onion. You need ~1/3 cup of each.
* Mix everything except the fish, butter, and wine in the bowl
* Put about 1-2 tablespoons of that ish on the fish fillets and roll each one up. Secure with toothpicks.
* Melt 2 tbsp of butter with 1 tsp of garlic. Add 1/2 cup of white wine.
* Put the filets on your baking pan and soak them in the butter mixture
* Bake for about 25 minutes<br/>

Hide the rest of the wine from me. I get very aggressive when I am hungry.
