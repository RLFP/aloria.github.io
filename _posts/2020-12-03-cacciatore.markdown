Put the ded in the red on the noodle bread.<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* 1 broiler/fryer chicken (3-1/2 to 4 pounds), cut up
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 2 celery ribs, sliced
* 1 large green pepper, cut into strips
* 1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
* 1 can (28 ounces) tomatoes, drained and chopped
* 1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce
* 1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste
* 1 cup dry red wine or water
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* Hot cooked pasta
* Grated Parmesan cheese


## Do this
* Get flour all over over the chicken like you're dusting for prints, throw on some S+P too
* Put the olive oil and the butter in a large skillet and get that to medium-high heat
* Brown all sides of your chicken, and then put the chicken off to the side.  He doesn't have to be cooked through, he's coming back in the third act.
* Keep all the chicken oil handy and add onion, celery, green pepper and mushrooms for a five minute head start
* Add all things tomato, wine, herbs, garlic, and sugar.
* Bring it to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 30 minutes
* Put the chicken back in the skillet with all the other stuff, cover it, and let it simmer for another 45-60mins.
* Towards the end of that hour, you're gonna wanna fire up some pasta to serve it over.
* Do not forget the parm.<br/>
