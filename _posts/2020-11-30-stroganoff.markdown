'beef stew' is not a secure password. It's not stroganoff.<br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* The pasta stuff:
  *A pot for pasta
  *Pasta like egg noodles or bowties
  *A pinch of salt
  *Water
  *A colander or strainer or something

* Also:
  * About a pound of ground beef
  * Some vegetable oil
  * Garlic powder
  * A pan to fry up the beef
  * A spatula
  * A couple of spoons
  * A can of cream of mushroom soup


## Do this
* Prep pasta
  * Put the pasta in the pot with a pinch of salt.
  * Fill the pot with enough water to cover the pasta plus like a half inch
  * Put this on the back stove burner and turn it on. You're going to want to watch this boil while you do the other stuff.
  * After it starts boiling, poke it with a fork every minute or so to see if you can stab a noodle - if you can do that, drain off any water using the strainer.

* Meanwhile:
  * Put a spoonful of vegetable oil in the pan, then put the ground beef on top of that.
  * Get a spoonful or two of garlic powder and toss it on the beef.
  * Turn the heat on medium and watch this cook.
  * Every 30 seconds or so, chop up the beef in the pan and stir it around. You want everything to be in small bits that are brown and hot.
  * If you get a bunch of fat, scoot the beef to one side and tip the pan a little the other way so you can get it out with a spoon.

* When the beef is browned:
  * Dump the can of cream of mushroom soup over the beef. Stir it around until everything is hot.
  * Put some noodles in a bowl
  * Put some beef stuff on top
  * Maybe add some salt and pepper, or sprinkle on some tarragon if you have it. I'm not your mom.

* Other things you can do:
  * Try having this on rice. It's good.
  * Add some spices other than garlic - try chipotle powder or summat.
  * Throw in some peas when you add the mushroom soup. Or chopped up carrots. Or both.
  * Try it with ground chicken or turkey or pork.
  * Throw in some spinach with the beef when it's almost done browning. Or chopped mushrooms. Let those cook down with it.<br/>
