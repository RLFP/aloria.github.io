## What you need
* A box of Kraft Dinner
* As much butter and milk as indicated on the box of Kraft Dinner
* A thicc hot dog

## Do this
* Get a pan big enough to stick a hot dog in and start boiling some water
* About an inch from the top of the hot dog, cut lengthwise in half. Cut each half until you have 8 tentacles.
* Boil the hot dog for about 5 minutes. Remove from water and set aside
* Dump macaroni in the boiling hot dog water and cook according to package directions. It’s just Kraft Dinner. You got this.
* Serve in a bowl with your octodog on top. You can give it little eyes with some peppercorns or something if you’re feeling fancy.<br/>
